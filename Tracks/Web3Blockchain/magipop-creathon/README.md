# Proof of creativity with magipop Creathon

Build a collaborative content platform, magipop Creathon, on Lit Protocol and CyberConnect to enable large-scale, community-driven co-creation.

Our project, magipop Creathon, is a decentralized content collaboration platform built on Lit Protocol. It allows users to collectively create and showcase narrative projects on topics they are passionate about. 

We built magipop Creathon using the Lit Protocol SDK and CyberConnect SDK. The Lit Protocol SDK allowed us to leverage the protocol's distributed storage capabilities to efficiently store creative content on IPFS. CyberConnect SDK allowed us to manage creator identities and social connections on-chain. Using Rust and WASM, we implemented core components like content storage, version control, and access management.

By taking advantage of Lit Protocol's distributed storage and CyberConnect's creator identity system, magipop Creathon enables seamless collaborative creation across a large community of creators. Creator identities make it easy to permission new projects while benefiting from an established reputation.

The platform provides creators with tools to submit ideas, iterate on content, and vote on contributions. The collaborative mapping visualization helps creators understand how their work fits into the broader storyscape. 

# Innovations

## Distributed Storage via Lit Protocol
Lit Protocol's distributed storage allows us to reliably and redundantly store all creative content on IPFS, ensuring its persistence while retaining creator ownership.

## Social Identity and Reputation via CyberConnect 
CyberConnect enables creators to establish their unique social identities and reputations on-chain, building trust and signaling quality across the creative community.

## Anonymous Voting via ZK-SNARKs
Leveraging zero-knowledge proofs, users can securely vote on content without publicly exposing their preferences. This enables consensus while protecting privacy.

By leveraging Lit Protocol and CyberConnect, magipop pioneers a new paradigm of collaborative creativity powered by social reputation and community curation.

## **Synergy & Contribution**
1. magipop fills the gap in Passion Economy and creator spaces, providing unique value.
2. magipop brings diverse creators into the ecosystem, expanding and enriching the community.
3. Positive Tokenomics enable creators to earn income beyond speculators, moving beyond Ponzi models towards real utility.
4. magipop utilizes Lit Protocol's storage and CyberConnect's identity system to integrate AI models for collaborative creativity.
5. By focusing on niche passion communities, magipop attracts dedicated and engaged users, increasing Protocol activity. 
6. magipop's transparent approach showcases blockchain strengths to onboard mainstream consumers.
7. As an innovative co-creation model, magipop demonstrates how Lit Protocol and CyberConnect enable next-gen community applications.

## One-liner
Al fused co-creation tool for community, forging large-scale creativity into evolving stories.
## Problem to be solved
In large-scale creative collaborations, it often becomes confusing, like those cluttered group chats, forums, posts
We want to find a way to aggregate large-scale ideas, but at the same time keep it structured, so that everyone who wants to participate can quickly get the big picture and the details needed to move forward on the same consensus.
Creathon is a platform where fans can collaboratively work on and showcase narrative projects on topics they're passionate about.

## Key structure design
### Co-creation Event: ZK Privacy
This contract is the cornerstone of our pioneering privacy system. With the assurance of zk-SNARK and autonomous Web3 infrastructure, users on Creathon can experience end-to-end privacy protection.
- Proof of Creation: Using zk technology, users can submit their creations and affirm their validity without revealing any content.
- Inspiration Proof: Harnessing zk-SNARK and Magiry.AI, users can verify the uniqueness of their inspirations without disclosing specific content. Concurrently, they can publicize their inspirations to motivate others.
- Double-blind Voting: Leveraging zk's one-way function, users can confirm the authenticity of their votes without exposing their actions.
We trust that while zk is the foundation of privacy, it also serves as a vital bridge to consensus.
## Decentralized Network via Lit Protocol
magipop Creathon leverages Lit Protocol's excellent seamless p2p network capabilities, secure Web3 infrastructure and robust ecosystem. This elevates the decentralized creative experience, driving innovation and collaborative growth.
### Idea tracking with LLM 
What distinguishes us is our creative AI assistant. The "detail_of" method integrates diverse ideas from creators into a structured map. This Lego-like approach enables collaborative creation under a shared worldview. As a user contributes an idea, our AI analyzes and connects it with related ideas.

Meanwhile, "Creathon" gamifies this process into an exciting competition. Creations are showcased on a map, highlighting interconnections for easy overview and detailed insights.
### magipop Data Chain
The magipop Map Contract utilizes Lit Protocol's distributed capabilities, AI, and collective creativity. By initiating with a unique contract hash, we enable a secure and transparent foundation for operations. Leveraging efficiency of Lit Protocol, we ensure crucial data is stored on IPFS, safeguarding creator contributions. The contract connects creators with concepts using functions like "post" and "detail_of". This promotes an organic flow of ideas and natural collaborations.
